Yeoman-phaser
=============

Kickstart template for building games using [Phaser](http://phaser.io) and [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io).

The Phaser game framework needs a webserver to run, so I decided to use Yeoman.


Use instructions
================

Having yeoman installed (and in a terminal):

- Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/aldoutrera/yeoman-phaser/`
- `cd yeoman-phaser`
- Install the dependencies `bower install`
- Start the server `grunt serve`
- You are good to code!

Once you are ready to ship, just `grunt`. This will compile all your assets and generate a build folder that you can upload (or push) to your hosting.

Hope you will find it useful.
